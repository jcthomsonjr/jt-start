				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The national media committed a major <em>faux pas</em> tonight against the people of Wisconsin. With people still in line waiting to vote, all of the major national news outlets called the vote for the incumbent (<a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_WISCONSIN_RECALL?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-06-05-21-51-27">AP</a> and the <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/primaries/results/live/wisconsin-recall?hp#sha=152a592e9">Times</a> were among the last). One commentator went so far as to talk about the science of vote prediction on election nights, lauding how well statistics can predict the outcome.</p>
<p>Whether or not this is true, it completely misses the fact that an early call has real potential to affect the outcome of the election. That this particular race was split by less than one percent by some polls the day before the election makes an accurate outcome even more important.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not a partisan message &#8211; it is equally likely that someone could step out of line thinking &#8220;we won&#8221; or &#8220;we lost.&#8221; The news media is largely expected to objectively report the events of the day, and this puts the drive for a &#8220;scoop&#8221; ahead of our democratic process. Should one person step out of line based on these messages strikes me as an affront to our democracy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Below is a letter that I sent to the members of the Joint Committee on Finance, to my own Senator and Representative, and to President Reilly and the members of the Board of Regents. While at times I feel my opinion is in the minority at Madison, this feeling also compels me to speak out.</p>
<p><span id="more-916"></span></p>
<p>I would like to express my opposition to the University of Wisconsin, Madison&#8217;s “New Badger Partnership.”  While I have some concerns about the public authority model, I believe it is most important to avoid splitting Madison from the rest of UW-System.  For this reason, I favor the Wisconsin Idea Partnership as proposed by President Reilly and the Regents.</p>
<p>I am currently both a graduate student and academic staff at UW-Madison.  My studies involve using a number of library tools which are licensed at the System level.  My work in the Academic Technology department of the Division of Information Technology, however, has given me greater insight into why the UW System works better as a whole.</p>
<p>I am currently Madison&#8217;s “backup” member of the System Learning Technology Development Council. This role has led me to deep and meaningful collaborations with other members of System. One might think that the flagship would have the most to offer our System peers. Quite the contrary!</p>
<p><em>Madison&#8217;s partnership with UW-System has impacted learning technology in ways that we could not have done alone – and this impact ultimately is felt by faculty and students in instruction.</em></p>
<p>Last week, I attended the President&#8217;s Summit which was host to presentations on teaching by faculty and staff from around the System.  This sort of information sharing is what makes public higher education in Wisconsin strong.</p>
<p>Please put your support behind the Wisconsin Idea Partnership.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent quite a bit of time feeling conflicted about my <a href="http://johnthomson.org/blog/2011/02/19/whats-happening-in-wisconsin-is-a-big-dirty-deal">last post</a>. For some time, it seemed too political, and I was humbled by the work of one of my professors. He made an insightful and reasoned post about how the protests can be a &#8220;teachable moment&#8221; in the mass communication classroom.</p>
<p>The events of the day, however, have brought be back to my convictions. A state politician basically <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=video&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CD8QtwIwAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxhY5KBGLw_k&amp;rct=j&amp;q=fitzgerald%20fox%20news&amp;ei=-GB4TeOsF4aU0QGb8aHxAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFe5YEE6y285ZNYCciJdSUj29RWOA&amp;sig2=-2BVV1wLU4EThWtBqT62aw&amp;cad=rja">went on the record</a> confirming everything that I speculated in that post. &#8220;What&#8217;s going on in Wisconsin&#8221; is an effort to attack the Democrat&#8217;s funding for elections. These protests are about class. These protests are about the role of corporations. These protests are about the rights of individuals to assemble and speak. These are all issues I care about.</p>
<p>There are a number of issues I would like to take the time to step back and blog about, though it&#8217;s very difficult to find the time. I need to find it, because it&#8217;s hard to be deep in 140 characters.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am not sure if I&#8217;ve ever completely tipped my political hand on the &#8220;pages&#8221; of my blog. These feelings are obviously my own, but my feelings are strong enough that I feel I am compelled to share them publicly. (re-posted from Facebook)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve received a public education, been cared for by a nurse,  hired an electrician,  been saved by a fire fighter or police officer,  driven a car, or are one of the Union members who work in these sectors,  this message is about what you can do to help them.</p>
<p>The news media has never been very friendly to unions.  There is a mass  distortion going on that is hiding an important fact about the dispute  over the Budget Repair Bill.  You have probably heard that unions are  fighting against the inevitable fiscal facts of tough economic times.   Do not believe it!</p>
<p>1) Our governor gave a tax break to corporations equal to that amount he wants unions to contribute.<br />
http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_90196216-3b66-11e0-a327-001cc4c03286.html</p>
<p>2) Nevertheless, Wisconsin&#8217;s major unions have offered concessions on  all economic portions of the bill, but refuse to give up their rights  of collective bargaining (a fact I heard every single large WI union  president repeat during a rally this afternoon).<br />
http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/education/blog/article_0b783598-3bb4-11e0-b872-001cc4c03286.html</p>
<p>Said another way: our governor manufactured our state&#8217;s financial  problem, and even though our labor unions are willing to bend, he and  the Republicans are SET on destroying our unions.  This dispute is NOT  about money &#8212; it is about workers&#8217; rights.</p>
<p>If you see your local (or national) media outlet perpetuating this  distortion &#8212; call them on it!  If they are not covering it at all &#8212;  ask why!  Send them a comment online, it&#8217;s easy, and it&#8217;s vital that all  of the players here in WI get a fair shake.</p>
<p>&#8211; Is this really an attack on unions?  Why? &#8211;</p>
<p>Thanks to the &#8220;Wisconsin 14,&#8221; we&#8217;ve had enough time to dig up the real  story on what is going on here.  You are free to make up your own mind,  but I find what is going on to be an appalling attack on the working  class.</p>
<p>* I&#8217;m not a Rachel Maddow viewer, but I think this 15 minute clip  paints an accurate picture of what is going on &#8211; rich, corporate  interests are trying to dismantle their one source of fiscal competition  in the political sphere: labor unions.<br />
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/vp/41655758</p>
<p>* Where is the money for all of the political action groups that  Maddow refers to coming from?  In large part, from the Koch brothers.<br />
http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/02/wisconsin-scott-walker-koch-brothers</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t know the Koch&#8217;s?  They are billionaires who use their money  (filtered through organizations) to push their far right wing agenda.<br />
http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer</p>
<p>* The Republican party in Wisconsin is also playing games with the  process.  When Assembly Democrats tried to offer legit amendments, the  Republicans pushed the process along without them.  This has the  Assembly Democrats (along with Wisconsin workers) MAD as hell!<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZsOKNfNkfQ</p>
<p>When faced with dirty tricks like this, who can blame the Senate  Democrats for leaving the state?  Who can blame the 70,000+ people who  marched for labor rights at Wisconsin&#8217;s capitol today?</p>
<p>I know what I&#8217;ve presented here is lot to read and watch, but Wisconsin,  workers, and anyone who leans any direction but far right MUST be  educated on these issues.  If you can, please boycott these companies  that have contributed to our Governor:</p>
<p>Johnsonville, Menards, Home Depot, Quik Trip, Walmart, SC Johnson,  Stainmaster, Brawney, Dixie cups, AT&amp;T, TDS, Hal Lenord publishing,  Woodmans, Metcalfe&#8217;s Sentry</p>
<p>I am not currently a union member, and I would take a  financial hit if the budget repair bill passes. Nevertheless, I&#8217;ve been  at the capitol for the last 5 days because I firmly believe that there  is great value in the public sector &#8211; these are the workers to which we  entrust our health, safety, and public welfare.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your kind words and support.  Forward!</p>

<p>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have just revealed their new strategy for working with the content industries to crack down on internet piracy (<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/11/how-isps-will-do-six-strikes-throttled-speeds-blocked-sites">How ISPs will do “six strikes”: Throttled speeds, blocked sites | Ars Technica</a>). The approach takes 3 phases: notice, acknowledgement, and punishment. A spokesperson said that the goal was not to stop heavy-downloading &#8220;serial pirates.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>[ISPs goal is to] educate &#8220;the vast majority of the people for whom trading in copyrighted material has become a social norm.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The 3 steps certainly have a better chance of success than the bland, generic copyright &#8220;education&#8221; of the past, but still might fall short for achieving the kind of change content owners are looking for.</p>
<p>My research is starting to reveal that norms usually trump law, despite &#8220;education&#8221; efforts. Media effects and psychological theories point to difficulty of overcoming factors like our natural tendency to think heuristically and the power of group norms. I&#8217;m sure these measures will bring a small decrease in downloading, but I predict a push-back as our culture engages in more online creativity. Especially if that creativity is an individual&#8217;s livelihood!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d argue that there are also issues of private enforcement of law here, but that is an issue for another day.</p>

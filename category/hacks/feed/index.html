<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s kind of sad, but sometimes open source projects slow way down. It happend to <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> (I switched to Leopard Mail, which came out around the same time that TB&#8217;s primary architects left the project), and now it appears to have happened to my favorite newsreader: <a href="http://gregarius.net/">Gregarius</a>.</p>
<p>Offline reading has always made <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a> awfully attractive, but the one Gregarius feature I couldn&#8217;t live without was a slider to shorten posts to a consistent length. This made it easy to skim the beginning of an article without too much scrolling.</p>
<p>Thus, we have my first UserStyle: <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/8488">Googe Reader Shrink Expanded View</a></p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t been turned on to user styles in Firefox yet, download the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2108">Stylish</a> add-on and check out this <a href="http://lifehacker.com/396741/functional-firefox-user-styles">Lifehacker post filled with useful styles</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Edit: </em>Somehow the sync isn&#8217;t starting, so I&#8217;ll need to figure out what the trouble is and update this post. Any ideas?<br />
<em>Edit 2: </em>It would seem using rsync to back up is no longer covered under the terms of service for BlueHost users.Â  I actually haven&#8217;t been doing my backups this way for some time, and would highly recommend using a service like <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTQyMDE1ODk">Dropbox</a> instead (especially since it has a nice web interface and syncs between multiple computers). I&#8217;ll leave this post up for users of other hosting providers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d call myself more of a tinker-er than a programmer, but I thought I&#8217;d open a new chapter in my blogging repertoire: sharing tech solutions I&#8217;ve come up with.  I&#8217;m a dissertator, which means I need frequent off-site backups, and a <a href="http://bluehost.com">BlueHost</a> user, which means I have a convenient place to upload to.</p>
<p><a href="http://addisonrd.com/WordPress/2007/03/how-to-backup-your-mac-to-a-dreamhost-server-part-1-of-2/">This post</a> taught me everything I needed to know to get rsync working with Bluehost (the instructions are for Dreamhost, but you get the idea). Be sure to check out the part for running a backup without logging in. Up until recently, I&#8217;ve used the terminal to periodically run a backup&#8211;yet there&#8217;s always room for improvement.</p>
<p>I dig <a href="http://growl.info">Growl</a>, and thought it would be great to schedule backups for every-other hour, and to have notification of when (or if) it completed successfully. I never quite worked out the completing successfully part, but the attached AppleScript is a start.  It checks for a network connection (be sure to enter the IP address of your host), and sends a growl when the backup starts (just be sure to wait a bit for the backup to complete).  <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/mac/2005/07/22/backup.html">Here is some advice</a> on scheduling via iCal.</p>
<p>I realize this (admittedly unedited) post didn&#8217;t quite live up to my reputation as a decent technical writer. I&#8217;d be happy to answer questions or take suggestions in comments.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Readers of this comment thread should know that oldhats and pkp646 are part of a tag-team of industry shills who invade blog comments on net neutrality or rleated issues to argue against any government regulation of the telephone companies. Other names who run with this crowd are John Rice, lessgov, AJ Carey and Paulaner01. (Google any of these names in combination and you&#039;ll see how their game works).

By tag-teaming the blogs, this small handful of individuals gives the false impression of broad popular support for an telco-friendly position.

What they fail to point out is that Net Neutrality has been the rule that has governed access to the Internet since its inception. It&#039;s the reason that the Internet has become such a dynamic force for new ideas, economic innovation and free speech.  What they really want is for Congress to radically re-write our telecommunications laws so that companies like AT&#038;T, Verizon and BellSouth can swoop in and become gatekeepers to Internet content -- in a way that benefits no one except the largest ISPs.

I&#039;d like these people to tell us how it is that they appear together (usually one after the other) spouting identical industry talking points.  

What gives fellas? Are you being paid to do this? And by whom?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John, all of the examples you sight only go to prove that government intereference was a major failure for those industries from a business point of view. The Post Office has never made any money, the rail lines are in constant need of subsidy (because of government regulations), and the net became a boom only after it left the damning hands of government control. While I&#039;m sure we both appreciate the internet, the best way to see it continue to succeed is to keep the hands of that &quot;impetuous vortex&quot; off.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry not to go into more depth on the copyright issue. From what I can gather from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kyle-brady.com/2009/06/10/how-i-won-a-copyfight/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;student&#039;s description of events&lt;/a&gt;, a bit of sharing of the homework assignment text was in question. Since it&#039;s pretty well understood that the student owns the copyright in his answer, the issue seemed to turn more on the issue of academic integrity. Though, it appears that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/06/16/computer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;others have a different opinion&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for posting this. My favorite quote from the article: &quot;assignments are ultimately more valuable to the students when the work that they produce can have broader purpose than merely fulfilling academic requirements.&quot; 

John - a question for you: Why wasn&#039;t copyright mentioned here? Is it true that students have copyright privileges over the work they produce as a class, and can then publish it in any way they choose?]]></description>

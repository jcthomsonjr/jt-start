				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Penn State colleague who we were fortunate enough to meet at (and before) Drupal Camp WI <a href="http://btopro.wordpress.com/2009/06/07/how-to-follow-with-such-incredible-momentum/">blogs about how we might keep the momentum of this event going</a>. He&#8217;s right that there are a number of similarities between our schools, and hopefully this will be an incentive to keep the connection alive. Sharing ideas about technology was great, but the real take-away was the idea of forming a Drupal in Higher Education consortium. What makes this idea special is that we, as universities, face challenges that are different from other sorts of Drupal users&#8211;both technological and political.Â  I&#8217;m not sure whether it would be attached to other Drupal camps, the <a href="http://www.cic.net">CIC</a><a href="http://www.itcnetwork.org/"></a>, or just be an online group (one thing that <a href="https://comets.wisc.edu/">ComETS</a> has taught our campus is that events are key to keeping connections alive). I wonder if a good way to start might be to find out who is interested, and then to find out what the strengths/needs of each are. We found a lot to agree about&#8211;even regarding the role of central vs distributed systems&#8211;so it would be a shame to let geography keep these good ideas from coming to fruition.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I gave 2 presentations at <a href="http://www.drupalcampwi.com">Drupal Camp WI</a> over the weekend.Â  One of them has been on my mind for quite some time.Â  When I first started learning Drupal, I could tell that there was a certain &#8220;thing&#8221; that was the hurdle to understanding the platform&#8211;once you get it, everything is more or less easily. I described the session as:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a &#8220;thing&#8221; about Drupal that makes it hard for beginners to get started, yet at the same time provides much of the platform&#8217;s flexibility and power. It&#8217;s also a &#8220;thing&#8221; that is easy for seasoned developers to forget after awhile.</p>
<p>This session will broadly cover site organization using content types, taxonomy, and views. We will cover strategies for planning a site and how you might &#8220;translate&#8221; needs into a structure in Drupal. If time is available, we will build a simple site using these modules and talk about how to search for additional modules when what&#8217;s there doesn&#8217;t fit the plan.</p>
<p>This session is for people who starting their first Drupal site, or for anyone who is considering Drupal for a project.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately for myself and those who couldn&#8217;t make the camp, most of the sessions were archived.Â  <a href="http://videos.med.wisc.edu/videoInfo.php?videoid=9365">Watch the video here</a>, and check out my slides below.</p>

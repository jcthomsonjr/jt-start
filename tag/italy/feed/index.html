		<description><![CDATA[Well, we may have been a bit hasty with judging Florence. This is a really nice town with a lot of nice people (once you get beyond where all of the tourists are hanging out).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, we may have been a bit hasty with judging Florence.  This is a really nice town with a lot of nice people (once you get beyond where all of the tourists are hanging out). I&#8217;ve already been asked directions a few times by Italians (I just say &#8220;sorry&#8221; in my best mid-western accent), but now our Italian is getting good enough to at least order food and coffee&#8230;oh, and Lyra got to use her Spanish when checking into our room here.  Lots of language fun.</p>
<p>Besides seeing the sites (the Duomo, Uffizi, etc&#8230;check out the <a href="http://johnthomson.org/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=9">gallery</a>), there is a festival going on every day we&#8217;re here.  Fireworks last night, and evidently for the next two nights. I think we can stay up for it this time. Hopefully our tired, hot feet can handle it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We spent the last two days in Milan and just arrived in Florence this afternoon.Â  So far, all of the Italians are really nice people.Â  From the subway operators, to the security guard who joked that we needed tickets when we really didnâ€™t, to the old guys on the train to Florence who gave us a â€œcheersâ€ with their sandwich before eatingâ€”everyone here is nice (even though we donâ€™t speak the language).Â  Milan was fun, especially b/c there werenâ€™t many tourists.Â  We saw everything from DaVinciâ€™s â€œThe Last Supper,â€ to Marconi Radios, to the roof of the Duomo Cathedral.</p>
<p>Florence is a little different.Â  Itâ€™s a very nice town, with nice people, and lots of American and Japanese tourists (and lots of English-speaking locals).Â  We havenâ€™t seen much yet, but with the heat weâ€™re taking advantage of siesta time (not much choice about it).Â  There have been a few real stories so far, so weâ€™ll have to see if thereâ€™s a better Internet connection here or in Rome to tell about our near transportation disasters, etc.</p>

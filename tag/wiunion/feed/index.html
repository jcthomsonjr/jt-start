				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent quite a bit of time feeling conflicted about my <a href="http://johnthomson.org/blog/2011/02/19/whats-happening-in-wisconsin-is-a-big-dirty-deal">last post</a>. For some time, it seemed too political, and I was humbled by the work of one of my professors. He made an insightful and reasoned post about how the protests can be a &#8220;teachable moment&#8221; in the mass communication classroom.</p>
<p>The events of the day, however, have brought be back to my convictions. A state politician basically <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=video&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CD8QtwIwAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxhY5KBGLw_k&amp;rct=j&amp;q=fitzgerald%20fox%20news&amp;ei=-GB4TeOsF4aU0QGb8aHxAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFe5YEE6y285ZNYCciJdSUj29RWOA&amp;sig2=-2BVV1wLU4EThWtBqT62aw&amp;cad=rja">went on the record</a> confirming everything that I speculated in that post. &#8220;What&#8217;s going on in Wisconsin&#8221; is an effort to attack the Democrat&#8217;s funding for elections. These protests are about class. These protests are about the role of corporations. These protests are about the rights of individuals to assemble and speak. These are all issues I care about.</p>
<p>There are a number of issues I would like to take the time to step back and blog about, though it&#8217;s very difficult to find the time. I need to find it, because it&#8217;s hard to be deep in 140 characters.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am not sure if I&#8217;ve ever completely tipped my political hand on the &#8220;pages&#8221; of my blog. These feelings are obviously my own, but my feelings are strong enough that I feel I am compelled to share them publicly. (re-posted from Facebook)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve received a public education, been cared for by a nurse,  hired an electrician,  been saved by a fire fighter or police officer,  driven a car, or are one of the Union members who work in these sectors,  this message is about what you can do to help them.</p>
<p>The news media has never been very friendly to unions.  There is a mass  distortion going on that is hiding an important fact about the dispute  over the Budget Repair Bill.  You have probably heard that unions are  fighting against the inevitable fiscal facts of tough economic times.   Do not believe it!</p>
<p>1) Our governor gave a tax break to corporations equal to that amount he wants unions to contribute.<br />
http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_90196216-3b66-11e0-a327-001cc4c03286.html</p>
<p>2) Nevertheless, Wisconsin&#8217;s major unions have offered concessions on  all economic portions of the bill, but refuse to give up their rights  of collective bargaining (a fact I heard every single large WI union  president repeat during a rally this afternoon).<br />
http://host.madison.com/ct/news/local/education/blog/article_0b783598-3bb4-11e0-b872-001cc4c03286.html</p>
<p>Said another way: our governor manufactured our state&#8217;s financial  problem, and even though our labor unions are willing to bend, he and  the Republicans are SET on destroying our unions.  This dispute is NOT  about money &#8212; it is about workers&#8217; rights.</p>
<p>If you see your local (or national) media outlet perpetuating this  distortion &#8212; call them on it!  If they are not covering it at all &#8212;  ask why!  Send them a comment online, it&#8217;s easy, and it&#8217;s vital that all  of the players here in WI get a fair shake.</p>
<p>&#8211; Is this really an attack on unions?  Why? &#8211;</p>
<p>Thanks to the &#8220;Wisconsin 14,&#8221; we&#8217;ve had enough time to dig up the real  story on what is going on here.  You are free to make up your own mind,  but I find what is going on to be an appalling attack on the working  class.</p>
<p>* I&#8217;m not a Rachel Maddow viewer, but I think this 15 minute clip  paints an accurate picture of what is going on &#8211; rich, corporate  interests are trying to dismantle their one source of fiscal competition  in the political sphere: labor unions.<br />
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/vp/41655758</p>
<p>* Where is the money for all of the political action groups that  Maddow refers to coming from?  In large part, from the Koch brothers.<br />
http://motherjones.com/mojo/2011/02/wisconsin-scott-walker-koch-brothers</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t know the Koch&#8217;s?  They are billionaires who use their money  (filtered through organizations) to push their far right wing agenda.<br />
http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer</p>
<p>* The Republican party in Wisconsin is also playing games with the  process.  When Assembly Democrats tried to offer legit amendments, the  Republicans pushed the process along without them.  This has the  Assembly Democrats (along with Wisconsin workers) MAD as hell!<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZsOKNfNkfQ</p>
<p>When faced with dirty tricks like this, who can blame the Senate  Democrats for leaving the state?  Who can blame the 70,000+ people who  marched for labor rights at Wisconsin&#8217;s capitol today?</p>
<p>I know what I&#8217;ve presented here is lot to read and watch, but Wisconsin,  workers, and anyone who leans any direction but far right MUST be  educated on these issues.  If you can, please boycott these companies  that have contributed to our Governor:</p>
<p>Johnsonville, Menards, Home Depot, Quik Trip, Walmart, SC Johnson,  Stainmaster, Brawney, Dixie cups, AT&amp;T, TDS, Hal Lenord publishing,  Woodmans, Metcalfe&#8217;s Sentry</p>
<p>I am not currently a union member, and I would take a  financial hit if the budget repair bill passes. Nevertheless, I&#8217;ve been  at the capitol for the last 5 days because I firmly believe that there  is great value in the public sector &#8211; these are the workers to which we  entrust our health, safety, and public welfare.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your kind words and support.  Forward!</p>

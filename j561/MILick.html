  <p><b><font size="3">The vision of J.C.R. Licklider</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Helvetica" size="3">Contrary to the thoughts of 
    computer experts of the time, Licklider realized the potential of a large 
    computer network for disseminating information and sharing ideas. The idea 
    that a computer might be more than a machine that does math was foreign to 
    the computer industry. This fact makes it clear that creating the network 
    for communication rather than data manipulation was a worthwhile cause; the 
    industry would most likely not attempt such a project. It soon became evident 
    that communications was the true benefit of the network (Hauben).</font></p>

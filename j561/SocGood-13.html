Aiding         research was part of the Internet¹s original intent, and by implementing         the NREN for this purpose the government is standing by its original plan.         By commercializing only part of the Internet the government has not totally         caved to the business special interest groups, yet still given them what         they wanted. The importance of research over the Internet remains to be         a vital part of its plan to develop greater bandwidth capacity that can         later be privatized.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The method of developing new         Internet technology for research and then turning it over to business         also helps to bring solid technology to the commercial Internet. If the         Internet was totally commercial there is no way to tell if the best standards         would be adopted. Through competitive bidding, the government is giving         all technology businesses a chance to have their technology become a standards         on the Internet. This not only helps the private sector economically,         but it also insures that the best technology will be implemented in any         future Internet developments. The standards that are developed under government         supervision will benefit society, because when future technology is privatized         the standards will have proven themselves in the research community.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Even though the government¹s         actions to commercialize the Internet are largely successful, the commercialization         is not a total benefit for society. One question that still must be asked         is in regards to if Internet access is really cheaper or more accessible         than it might have been under government control. With market forces dictating         the price of getting online it is conceivable that the demand for Internet         service is driving prices up. Perhaps if the government took care of Internet         access for all citizens, prices could be lower and access would be guaranteed.         It is not clear that prices would be lower, but it is clear that guaranteed         Internet access for all citizens would be a benefit to society. The growing         information divide has afforded many of the country¹s more affluent citizens         with access, but left many poorer citizens outside of the network. With         the growing need for technologically educated workers this has the potential         to lock the less fortunate out of the job market. In effect, the information         divide may result in a socioeconomic divide. The exclusion of many citizens         from the Internet brings questions to the benefit of commercially provided         access.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overall, the government has         done the right thing for society by remaining true to the Internet's research         roots, while still offering businesses opportunities to expand the Internet         for consumers. Society has benefited because not only because the research         community has tested the Internet technology before they use it, but also         because of the wealth of communication that a commercial Internet offers.</font></p>    </td>  </tr></table><table width="702" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" height="23">  <tr>    <td width="19%">      <p><a href="mailto:jcthomsonjr@students.wisc.edu"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">E-mail         the<br>        Author / Webmaster</font></a></p>      <p>&copy;2000 John Thomson, Jr</p>    </td>    <td width="81%">       <div align="right"><br>        <a href="conclusion.html"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FF3333">Next...</font></a></div>      <div align="right"></div>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>

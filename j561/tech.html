Instead of a modem, or a IMP, packet radio uses a Terminal Node           Controller (TNC) to connect the computer to make the connection between           computers. While it was first used to connect computers across the Hawaiian           islands, amateur radio operators have embraced it to this day. Amateur           radio operators have always been helpful to advance technology for free,           on their own time.

TCP breaks up the data into smaller           pieces, while IP is responsible for sending the data to the correct           location. TCP also puts the data pieces back together and makes sure           that it is correctly received. TCP/IP emerged as a standard of communication           on the Internet. If everyone used different protocols it would be difficult           for computers to &quot;talk&quot; to each other. A standard protocol           makes the Internet a much more efficient creature.</font>           <ul>            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although TCP/IP is somewhat               difficult to understand, there is much to <a href="gopher://gopher-chem.ucdavis.edu/11/Index/Internet_aw/Intro_the_Internet/intro.to.ip/">read</a>               about it.</font></li>          </ul>        </li>        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><a name="DNS"></a>Name           Servers</b> and <b>Domain Name Servers</b> (<b>DNS</b>) are the devices           (actually they are programs that run on the main network computers)           that allow network users to use names instead of numbers to send and           retrieve information. In effect, it is like being able to tell a telephone           the name of the person you wish to call instead of dialing their number.           Name servers, the first of the two technologies, were located at each           host computer in the network. They contained a list of all the possible           names that someone could connect to, and routed the information to the           number that connected with the name. Domain name servers were introduced           because the lists on each name server grew very long and demanded a           great deal of network traffic to update. The advantage of DNS is that           if a server does not know the number address that connects to a name,           it forwards the request to another DNS. In this way, messages can find           their route, but each server does not need to keep the long list of           <i>every</i> possible address. The standards that DNS brought were also           responsible for creating the &quot;.com,&quot; &quot;.edu,&quot; and           other domain names that users have become so familiar with. DNS and           name servers had a very important effect in that they make the Internet           usable to the average person. If each person had to remember the number           of each they wished to visit, everyone would have to have an enormous           &quot;network book,&quot; much like a phone book.</font>           <ul>            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you have your own               network, you can set up your own DNS server. <a href="http://www.ludd.luth.se/%7Ekavli/BIND-FAQ.html">Here</a>               is how to do it.

While this sounds incredibly similar to TCP/IP,           routers are the <i>machine</i> that interprets the <i>protocol</i>.           In fact, if two machines attempt to communicate by using different protocols,           it is the routers job to make sure that they communicate properly. While           a routers job is simple to understand, the Internet could not function           without them. Routers at major network points have to be able to handle           millions of requests per second. This is difficult when you consider           that they must not only figure <i>a</i> route for the information to           travel, but they must also determine the <i>best</i> route--no small           task, considering the amount of traffic that flows over the Internet.           Routers are essentially the machines that make the Internet run.</font>           <ul>            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pictured is a router               for a small network from <a href="http://www.3Com.com/">3Com</a>,               the prices range from just over $100 to<img src="images/3comrouter.jpg" width="199" height="71" align="right">               many thousands for the larger networks .</font></li>            <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Learn <a href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/router.htm">how               routers work</a> in more detail, or go to <a href="http://www.cisco.com/">Cisco</a>'s               (the &quot;king&quot; of routers) web page.</font></li>          </ul>          <p>&nbsp;</p>          <p>&nbsp;</p>        </li>        <li><a name="Modem"></a><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Modems</b>           are the machines that connect computers to phone lines.

Because of the greater connection that the Internet has         brought between countries, a truly global economy has emerged. Not only         has the number of corporate Internet sites exploded, but many have also         begun to offer additional versions of their home page in other languages.         The ease of communication across national boundaries that the Internet         has increased the scope of a single corporation. It is now easier than         ever for American corporations to communicate with managers working in         factories in other countries. The commercial Internet has also allowed         people to sell things from their web sites, conceivably to anywhere in         the world.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In addition to globalizing         the economy, the commercialized Internet has also helped to foster an         information and service based economy. The large amount of technical knowledge         involved in operating a computer or network has increased the need for         technically knowledgeable service people. Since any website can conceivably         host an unlimited amount of content, workers have also been hired to fulfil         this information need. Due to the increase in content and data, society         has come to see information as a commodity. Entire businesses are made         simply to manipulate data or create content (<a href="bib.html#OTACritical"><font color="#FF0000">OTA</font></a>         1990). Here in the U.S., there has been an enormous economic growth due         largely to the success of Internet companies­the "dot-coms." The growth         of American Internet companies lured many people into playing the stock         market. Combined with the ease of online trading, the success of the dot-coms         helped the U.S. to enjoy a period of economic boom. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Unfortunately, the growth of         the commercial Internet has also hurt some sectors of the economy. The         retail industry is very quick to blame the Internet as the source of their         financial shortcomings during a time of economic expansion. They believe         that, since people can now do their shopping online, fewer are making         the drive to physical retail outlets. The impact of this might be lessened         by the trend of many retail businesses¹ offering online versions of their         usual stores. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another problem not as directly         connected with the commercialization of the Internet is the battle over         copyright infringement. Since the Internet is a digital technology anyone         on the Internet can make an exact copy of nearly anything with very little         effort. This has caused a great deal of copyright infringement. Producers         and owners of content (including words, pictures, and music) are all declaring         that their profits are being hurt by the ease in which their content can         be copied. While this is a problem that might have also occurred on a         non-commercial Internet, it is still worth addressing the fact that it         has changed the way that many people think about copyright law. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One other economic change that         the commercial Internet has brought is the standardization of the networks.         While it is not clear if this is a benefit, the fact remains that the         connection of networks involved a great deal of standardization. Now that         most computer networks "talk" to each other, there has been a need for         common ways to "speak" (such as TCP/IP), and to interconnect. Typically         technological arenas that are governed not by one body, but by the various         business firms and market forces have difficulty in deciding on one standard.         When many different players are attempting to have their technology become         the standard, the growth of a technology is slowed. This has not been         the case in the development of the Internet. The fostering of the technology         by the government helped to create a standardized way of operating the         network. A similar problem occurs when very few (often two) vendors are         trying to standardize their version of a technology. While there is some         disagreement whether this is a benefit of a fault, it is again clear that         with the care of the government in its development, this was not the case         with the development of the Internet (<a href="bib.html#Greenstein"><font color="#FF0000">Greenstein</font></a>).         </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another question regarding         standards is if the act of standardization encourages innovation. While         it may seem that a standard may be a hindrance to innovation, it is generally         the case that businesses "do not have sufficient incentives to embed interoperable         technology in their equipment," (<a href="bib.html#Greenstein"><font color="#FF0000">Greenstein</font></a>).         It appears that in the case of standardization, the course that the government         followed in the development of the Internet helped the network to grow         into the creature that it is today. </font></p>    </td>  </tr></table><table width="702" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" height="23">  <tr>    <td width="19%">      <p><a href="mailto:jcthomsonjr@students.wisc.edu"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">E-mail         the<br>        Author / Webmaster</font></a></p>      <p>&copy;2000 John Thomson, Jr</p>    </td>    <td width="81%">       <div align="right"><br>        <a href="SocReplace-12.html"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FF3333">Next...</font></a></div>      <div align="right"></div>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>

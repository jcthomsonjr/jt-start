This limitation was         the driving factor in the creation of Usenet and other inter-university         networks. Another such non-ARPAnet university network was formed in 1981         by CUNY and Yale Universities. The students called it BITnet ("Because         It¹s There" network) because the network connected the computers using         the protocol that was packaged ("there") with IBM¹s mainframe computers.         Again, BITnet used existing telephone lines to connect the computers together,         and given its low cost many other institutions joined the network. By         1990, over 3000 institution-sites were connected to the network enabling         them all to exchange e-mail (again note that this communication was most         likely not totally for research purposes) (<a href="bib.html#moschovitis"><font color="#FF0000">Moschovitis</font></a>).         The National Science Foundation also recognized the limited access of         educational institutions. Their first answer to this problem was a grant         given to the University of Wisconsin, Madison¹s chair of the Computer         Science Department, Larry Landweber. The network that he created in 1981,         CSnet, was chiefly used by academic and industrial researchers in the         field of computer science. The network was in fact a precursor to the         forthcoming NSFnet. <a href="timeline.html"><img src="images/timeline.jpg" width="108" height="18" border="0" align="middle"></a></font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/arpanet1980.gif" width="529" height="356"></font></p>      <p>ARPAnet in Oct., 1980</p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mid-eighties brought many         technical advances that created many of the Internet standards that are         still used today. In 1983 ARPAnet forced all of its servers to switch         to the <a href="javascript:Start('MItcpip.html')";><font color="#FF0000">TCP/IP</font></a>         protocol. Many see this as another defining moment because it standardized         the protocol that the Internet uses to this day; since ARPAnet led the         way, many other networks followed. Also in that year, name servers were         introduced to the network, again at the University of Wisconsin under         the supervision of Larry Landweber. <a href="tech.html#DNS" target="_blank"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" color="#FF0000">&lt;T&gt;</font></a>         The job of the name server was to translate the numbers of a physical         network address (in the form of 123.456.789.000, standardized by TCP/IP)         into actual names that were understandable to the users. Each machine         would have its own name that ARPAnet users could remember, however each         server also had to keep a list of the hosts that a user could connect         to. The implication of this was that any site that a server¹s administrator         did not think was appropriate (or perhaps contained commercial content)         could be excluded from the list, thus making it very difficult to route         to a "blacklisted" server. This process was made much simpler in 1984         when Domain Name Servers (DNS) replaced the name servers. The advantage         of DNS was that if one¹s own server did not know the address of a particular         name, it would forward the request to another server or to a centralized         list. This eliminated the need for each server to hold large files and         allowed the number of Internet servers to grow more rapidly. The use of         DNS was also aided by Cisco Corporation¹s introduction of Internet <a href="javascript:Start('MIrouter.html')";><font color="#FF0000">routers</font></a>         in the same year. <font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><a href="tech.html#router" target="_blank"><font color="#FF0000">&lt;T&gt;</font></a></font>         <a href="timeline.html"><img src="images/timeline.jpg" width="108" height="18" border="0" align="middle"></a>         </font></p>    </td>  </tr></table><table width="702" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" height="23">  <tr>    <td width="19%">      <p><a href="mailto:jcthomsonjr@students.wisc.edu"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">E-mail         the<br>        Author / Webmaster</font></a></p>      <p>&copy;2000 John Thomson, Jr</p>    </td>    <td width="81%">       <div align="right"><br>        <a href="NSFcreate-4.html"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FF3333">Next...</font></a></div>      <div align="right"></div>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>

Following the acceptance of commercial traffic and         the large push to get "America Online," the number of users of the Internet         increased faster than that of any other new medium. Perhaps if the Internet         had never been privatized there would not have been as many new users         of the network. Some argue that the Internet has helped to break down         social ties, much in the same way that has been blamed on television.         If this were entirely true, than it could be said that the Internet has         made computer users poorer in <a href="javascript:Start('MIsocap.html')";><font color="#FF0000">social         capital</font></a>. However, the Internet has also helped to form new         communication ties. Subnetworks of the Internet such as chat rooms, newsgroups,         e-mail lists, and web pages have helped to bring people together to discuss         their ideas. While the conversations might not build up democracy and         society in the ways that social critics like Robert Putnam claim are necessary         (through face-to-face interaction within a physical community), it is         conceivable that people are involved in more interaction than they were         when the television was the medium of choice. The replacement of television         by the Internet in the use of Americans¹ free time might be an aid to         increasing social ties necessary for a society that functions well. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another effect that the Internet         has had is a standardization of English as an international language.         While computers essentially communicate with numbers, the english-based         Domain Name system has brought English to the forefront as the language         of computers. Anyone in the world who wants to surf the Internet must         at least know some English; they must at least know enough to type a name         such as &quot;yahoo.com.&quot; Even though many sites are offered in other         languages, a user must know English to connect with the majority of web         sites. Or so I thought... On November 9, 2000 a test-bed was formed for         registering domain names in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. While the names         must still end in &quot;.com&quot; (etc), this may be an important step         in evening out the language barriers that are inherent in the current         domain name system (<a href="bib.html#hobbes"><font color="#FF0000">Hobbes</font></a>).         Perhaps this has been an important step towards the use of English as         the international language. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The control that once existed         over commercial speech on the Internet kept the networks from realizing         their potential as a commercial messenger. It might be said that the original         Internet regulations kept the "medium" of the networks from fully realizing         the "message" that they were capable of. Now that businesses are allowed         to transmit over the Internet there has been a great deal of change in         their messages. The interactivity of the Internet allows businesses to         practice better customer service, as it is now as easy as an e-mail to         get in touch with large corporations. The medium of commercialized computer         networks has in some ways made interacting with large businesses more         personal. The fact that consumers can communicate more easily with producers         has changed the dynamic of commercial interaction. Before the Internet,         consumers had to go to greater lengths to communicate with the commercial         sector (such as through the telephone or &quot;snail&quot; mail). The         messages that the Internet allows has in some ways brought these two interests         together. </font></p>    </td>  </tr></table><table width="702" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" height="23">  <tr>    <td width="19%">      <p><a href="mailto:jcthomsonjr@students.wisc.edu"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">E-mail         the<br>         Author / Webmaster</font></a></p>      <p>&copy;2000 John Thomson, Jr</p>    </td>    <td width="81%">       <div align="right"><br>        <a href="SocGood-13.html"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FF3333">Next...</font></a></div>      <div align="right"></div>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>

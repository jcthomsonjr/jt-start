Other network service providers felt that the anti-commercial         acceptable use policy of the NSFnet put them at a disadvantage. The NSF         was hesitant to open up their network for all commercial activity because         they did not want commercial networks to financially benefit from the         network provided by taxpayer dollars. In essence, the NSF would not allow         commercial messages to be transmitted over their network. However, ANS         was using the lines of that network for their own commercial benefit (due         to the &quot;extra&quot; space that they created). Many in the industry         saw this as a blatant conflict and they criticized the NSF for allowing         ANS to weasel their way around the AUP. The decision to allow ANS to use         the additional network capacity for their own profit was defended by then         NSF networking division director, Stephen Wolff. He defended ANS by stating,         "They [IBM and MCI] made an investment, they competed fairly [in the competition         for the bid to upgrade the lines to T3s], and having won the competition,         they took a business risk," (<a href="bib.html#fisherdec91"><font color="#FF0000">Fisher</font></a>         Dec 1991). Eventually however, Wolf would prove to change his opinions         in favor of commercializing the network. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Criticism of the NSF's resistance         to commercial interests and the perceived commercial advantage given to         ANS came from both inside and outside of the government. One congressperson         instrumental in the commercializing of the NSFnet was Rep. Rick Borcher,         D-VA. As the chair of the House Science Subcommittee he had a great deal         of power to express his opinion that, "Šthe network is structured [so]         that all commercial providers of network services receive equal treatment         and that government policy in managing the network not favor any provider         or set of providers over others." Outside of the government, representatives         from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (<a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>)         criticized the NSF's acceptable use policy. Mitchell Kapor, the EFF's         president, stated that the restrictions on commercialism harm the potential         of the future Internet, "by precluding widespread offering of commercial         electronic information services and discouraging commercial organizations         from making full use of the Internet," (<a href="bib.html#killette"><font color="#FF0000">Killette</font></a>).         Criticism such as this was becoming quite common, and the NSF was begining         to feel the pressure.</font></p>    </td>  </tr></table><table width="702" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" height="23">  <tr>    <td width="19%">      <p><a href="mailto:jcthomsonjr@students.wisc.edu"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">E-mail         the<br>        Author / Webmaster</font></a></p>      <p>&copy;2000 John Thomson, Jr</p>    </td>    <td width="81%">       <div align="right"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FF3333"><br>        <a href="NSFpolicy-7.html"><font color="#FF0000">Next...</font></a></font></div>      <div align="right"></div>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>

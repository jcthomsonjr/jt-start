The answer to this         problem was a "reinterpretation" of the NSFnet Acceptable Use Policy.         In March of 1993, as legislation for the National Information Infrastructure         (NII) was being considered, the NSF decided to reinterpret the AUP to         allow more commercial traffic over the NSFnet backbone. By stating that         the NSF was only a customer of ANS, the AUP was interpreted to mean that         ANS was free to use their portion of the backbone however they saw fit.         This was a partial answer to the questions over the acceptability of their         using the network for commercial traffic (<a href="bib.html#TillJohnson"><font color="#FF0000">Till         Johnson</font></a>). While this did not satisfy the questions that many         had over the "unfair advantage" that was given to ANS, it did help to         show that the NSF was willing to consider commercial traffic over their         network. Even if it did not satisfy everyone, it was an important step         in commercializing the Internet. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> When it was known that the         physical network was going to need an upgrade, an opportunity was seen         to open the floodgates to commercialization of the Internet. One of the         first signs that the NSF was buckling under the commercial pressure came         in March of 1992 when both sides met at a congressional committee meeting.         During that meeting NSF Networking Director, Stephen Wolff told committee         chair Rep. Boucher that, "If Congress allowed us to relax it [the Acceptable         Use Policy], we'd go along with it." Others outside the NSF were strongly         arguing that, "The acceptable use policy should be dropped." It seems         like no surprise when the NSF began to move behind commercializing the         Internet (<a href="bib.html#messmermarch92"><font color="#FF0000">Messmer</font></a>         March 1992). <a href="timeline.html"><img src="images/timeline.jpg" width="108" height="18" border="0" align="middle"></a>         </font></p>      <p><b>How they commercialized the Internet</b></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The solution to the National         Science Foundation¹s problem was to alter the way they funded the growing         Internet. Due to ANS¹ apparent success with expanded commercial use of         the NSF backbone and the growing success of the non-profit CIX, the NSF         felt that market forces were sufficient to sustain an operable national         network without their policies or control. It was decided that the network         could be handed over to commercial entities; but, it had to be insured         that the transition would happen in a fair manor. The answer to the fairness         issue came with the 1991 New Project Development Plan, and later The National         Information Infrastructure Act of 1993 (<a href="bib.html#abbate"><font color="#FF0000">Abbate</font></a>         195-199). <a href="timeline.html"><img src="images/timeline.jpg" width="108" height="18" border="0" align="middle"></a>         </font></p>    </td>  </tr></table><table width="702" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" height="23">  <tr>    <td width="19%">      <p><a href="mailto:jcthomsonjr@students.wisc.edu"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">E-mail         the<br>        Author / Webmaster</font></a></p>      <p>&copy;2000 John Thomson, Jr</p>    </td>    <td width="81%">       <div align="right"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FF3333"><br>        <a href="NSFlaw-9.html"><font color="#FF0000">Next...</font></a></font></div>      <div align="right"></div>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>

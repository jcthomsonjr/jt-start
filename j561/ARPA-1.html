At its start, there were many separate networks         with little or no linkage between them. <img src="images/illiac-iv_t.jpg" width="200" height="135" align="right">The         first computer network to be established over a wide area was the US Department         of Defense&#146;s (DOD) Advanced Research Projects Agency network, or         ARPAnet. Following the Soviet launch of Sputnik President Dwight D. Eisenhower         felt that there needed to be both a network of highways connecting American         cities and a network between defense and research computers (<a href="bib.html#Gromov"><font color="#FF0000">Gromov</font></a>).         The result was the Interstate Highway System and the DOD&#146;s ARPAnet.         A man by the name of Dr. J.C.R. Licklider was put in charge of networking         the computers to promote national defense research. &quot;Lick&quot; had         the <a href="javascript:Start('MILick.html')";><font color="#FF0000">vision</font></a>         of the benefits of computer networks for human communication, but the         technological problems of connecting the computers together still had         to be overcome.</font></p>      <p align="right">An ILIAC computer, typical of the &quot;supercomputers&quot;         that were connected by ARPAnet</p>      <p><font face="Helvetica">&#9;Once the initial problems of connecting the         computers together and getting them to &quot;speak&quot; to each other         in the same language were<a href="images/ARPAnetDec69.jpg"><img src="images/ARPAnetDec69.jpg" width="262" height="160" align="right" border="0"></a>         solved, the network was technologically free to expand. A computer named         an Interface Message Processor (IMP) was instrumental in solving this         problem. <a href="tech.html" target="_blank"><font color="#FF0000">&lt;<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">T</font>&gt;</font></a>         After the IMP was connected to dedicated phone lines (a network already         well established across the nation) the machine&#146;s job was to know         where to route the information, check the transmissions for errors and         confirm the arrival of each piece of data. Each point on the new ARPA         network had to have its own IMP in order to join. The IMPs have evolved         from their 1969 (the year of ARPAnet&#146;s implementation) form into         the routers that the Internet uses today (<a href="bib.html#Moschovitis"><font color="#FF0000">Moschovitis</font></a>).         </font></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p align="right">ARPAnet in Dec., 1969</p>      <p><font face="Helvetica">&#9;It was not long until scientists were discovering         methods of linking computers together. In 1970 a network was created between         4 of the Hawaiian islands via radio signals. The network, named ALOHAnet,         brought the birth of packet radio, and also the idea to later connect         computers together via satellite. <a href="tech.html#packet" target="_blank"><font color="#FF0000">&lt;<font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">T</font>&gt;</font></a>         These were important discoveries due to the fact that they would evolve         into methods of networking that were not tied to wires on the ground.</font></p>      <p><font face="Helvetica">In 1974, the same company that was contracted         to construct ARPAnet (BBN) created TELEnet as a commercial twin to the         Defense Department&#146;s network. BBN started the company after they         heard that the ARPA network would be handed over to a private company.         Its creation brought the public their first chance to venture into computer         networking. Even though it was in no way tied to the ARPAnet, <i>it was         an important first step toward the commercialization of the Internet</i>.         <a href="timeline.html"><img src="images/timeline.jpg" width="108" height="18" border="0" align="middle"></a></font></p>    </td>  </tr></table><table width="706" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" height="23">  <tr>    <td width="19%">      <p><a href="mailto:jcthomsonjr@students.wisc.edu"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">E-mail         the<br>        Author / Webmaster</font></a></p>      <p>&copy;2000 John Thomson Jr</p>    </td>    <td width="81%">       <div align="right"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><br>        <a href="develop-2.html"><font color="#FF3333">Next...</font></a></font></div>      <div align="right"></div>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>

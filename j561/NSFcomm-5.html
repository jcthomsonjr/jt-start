The answer, surprisingly, does not come entirely         from any national policy, but instead from the workings of the National         Science Foundation­creator of the NSFnet. Only one year after the network         was started, the NSF gave a grant to Merit Network, a non-profit company         consisting of University of Michigan schools and the state of Michigan,         to administer the network that was being built. Around the time when the         NSF contracted Merit to upgrade the network to T1 lines, MCI and IBM collaborated         with Merit to form a non-profit service named Advanced Network and Services         (ANS ). Later, this corporation was awarded the contract to manage the         network when the contract with Merit ran out. As early as 1988 the NSF         was looking into commercializing their network through conferences on         "The Commercialization and Privatization of the Internet" at Harvard's         Kennedy School of Government, and also on the "com-priv" Usenet list.</font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1991 the debate became more         vigorous when congress considered the funding of a National Research and         Education Network (NREN). The new network was to be based on existing         networks, but was to operate at a much higher speed. While many in the         private sector felt that there was already a technologically sufficient         commercial network emerging, many in government saw that the U.S. was         lagging in technology when compared to other countries. </font></p>      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A formal proposal was submitted         to congress for a new network to be built with government funding, but         later to be commercialized or be commercially run. After a failure in         1990, the main proponent of the proposal, Al Gore, successfully persuaded         congress to pass the High Performance Computing Act of 1991 into law.         The new law called for funding of the proposed NREN to link educational         institutions. Those arguing against the bill were expressing a growing         concern that the government was taking too large a role in the building         of the Internet, and that it was giving some an unfair advantage (<a href="bib.html#fisherjuly91"><font color="#FF0000">Fisher</font></a>         July 1991). When ANS began upgrading the network to T3 lines (also in         1991), they received permission from the government to supply more <a href="javascript:Start('MIbandwidth.html')";><font color="#FF0000">bandwidth</font></a>         than the NSF required for their network. From this extra "space" on the         network they were allowed to set up their own commercial network service,         ANS CO+RE (Commercial + Research) (<a href="bib.html#messmerdec91"><font color="#FF0000">Messmer</font></a>         Dec 1991). <a href="timeline.html"><img src="images/timeline.jpg" width="108" height="18" border="0" align="middle"></a></font></p>    </td>  </tr></table><table width="702" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" height="23">  <tr>    <td width="19%">      <p><a href="mailto:jcthomsonjr@students.wisc.edu"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">E-mail         the<br>        Author / Webmaster</font></a></p>      <p>&copy;2000 John Thomson, Jr</p>    </td>    <td width="81%">       <div align="right"><font face="Techno, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#FF3333"><br>        <a href="NSFcriticism-6.html"><font color="#FF0000">Next...</font></a></font></div>      <div align="right"></div>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>

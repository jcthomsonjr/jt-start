		<description><![CDATA[I struggle a little with this line:
&quot;Knowledge and wisdom are two aspects of life development that I am skeptical can happen outside of a residential education.&quot; 
Though I understand have sympathy with this view I&#039;m not sure if this is intrinsic to online or more a reflection on how we do online (both in terms of comparative maturity of our understanding of online ed ) I also feel that we can judge online by criteria that face to face might also struggle with (though we mostly know how one would fix the problem in f2f).
I also wonder at what point we should prioiritise access over depth (I dislike even thinking about that question but increasingly in my mind refuse to have a debate about quality which doesn&#039;t talk about access a a factor - no critique of your thoughts is intended here, it&#039;s more that that is where my head is at with this debate). 
There is also perhaps a deeper debate about online /offline , degrees of &#039;real&#039;, and dualism which lurks in this conversations. I need to read those two pieces that prompted your reflection. Thank you for writing this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi John,

Thanks for sharing this with me.

I can imagine people in the &quot;learning sciences&quot; figuring out how to articulate badges with the kind of Knowledge Map you described. Whether they will or not, remains to be seen.

I also think that some of the work with badges by educators working with younger learners might have &quot;relational&quot; learning in mind. I would have to dig deeper to know for certain, but I think some of those experimenting with and thinking about badges, like Dan Hicks at Indiana, are mindful of the concerns you raise.

The U.C.-Davis program in Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems may be an example of a medium point in which faculty have developed a program, and associate badges with accomplishments and achievements that cross course and field experiences.

But, perhaps more to the point, is that badges will likely gain the most traction in being awarded for discrete skills and accomplishments associated with occupational standards that can be expressed as &quot;competencies.&quot; And, it is likely to be commercial testers and credential developers, like Professional Examination Services, as well as larger, private education and workforce preparation firms that will bring badges to the masses.

It is also likely that badges will enter academia at the community college level, and even there, in the non-credit and continuing education terrain, before they enter traditional four-year institutions in a major way.

Best,

Michael

P.S. Did you ask why Khan is all of a sudden advertising in a big way on television? What is the competition they are worrying about?]]></description>

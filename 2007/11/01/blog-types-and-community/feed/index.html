		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jerry,
Sorry to take so long; my Wordpress didn&#039;t alert me to your reply.

While something like Gizmodo or Slashdot gets labeled a blog simply because it technically follows the &quot;timed posting&quot; model, I wonder if what separates them from a more traditional blog is personality or voice. For example, CNet features a number of &quot;blogs,&quot; but all seem to fall under the larger editorial umbrella of CNet.com.  This is off the top of my head, but perhaps a blog leans more towards traditional media when it loses a more personal editorial voice.  Wired has great writers, but they don&#039;t give the same &quot;feel&quot; as a letter from a friend.

You might search my blog for comments on editors for more of my feelings on the issue.

Thanks for reading!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[John,

I stumbled across this post as I was looking around for people struggling with defining and categorizing what many people call &quot;blogs.&quot;

Thanks, John for you work in this area.  I&#039;m head of strategic planning for a marketing communications firm (www.brodeur.com).  I find that understanding what is (and is not) a &quot;blog&quot; is no small task.

The question I&#039;d pose is this:  when does a blog become simply the label of a format for what otherwise appears to be mainstream media?  Is Gizmodo a blog or simply an electronic magazine.  HuffingtonPost?  TechCrunch?  GigaOm?

I believe they share more points in common with traditional media than with the humble origins of personal web logs.  And Gawker?  Federated?  What about the blog syndicates?  They&#039;re looking more and more like Hearst and Gannett.

Best,

Jerry Johnson

		<description><![CDATA[HI John:

Thanks for the great post! I cited your blog typology in my class construct paper about blog, and it&#039;s really great! I would add more examples of the &quot;network&quot; blogs--Blogs function in MSN instant messanger: you can open the reading limit to only few friends who are in your MSN friend lists. The same is my Taiwaness blog that I can add friends who have the blog&#039;s account and only those friends can read or comment on my blogs. 

Therefore, I think network blogs can fit into the four catogories of blogs you mentioned. Maybe I would say it&#039;s just the function that bloggers can decide who can read or who can comment their blogs instead of a new category of blog. This &quot;audience&quot; function exists in the four kinds of blogs too: Different levels of bloggers contribute to the content (individual, group, submission, mixed), and these blogs can dicide who can read and who can comment. 

In my paper I try to define what blog is and I argue that if nobody &quot;can&quot; read your blog--although it turns out to be an online private journal--the form is still a blog. I know some people would argue that the essence of blogs is &quot;community&quot;, but blog users use blogs in so many different ways. One of my professor said maybe it&#039;s time to give a new name of the &quot;blog.&quot; 

Thanks a lot for this great idea! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right...I&#039;d agree that it&#039;s all about the network.  That&#039;s the one strength of Robin @ CyberSocÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s types over mine in that the focus there is over how information is shared rather than created. More private, social network-y blogs really focus on this by building on already existing networks.
I would say that a course blog does the same thing: capitalizing on an already existing social network (be it the course or a collaborative group).

Do blogs need to post to the world stage? I think of this almost in terms of the tree falling in the woods: if you post to a blog and no one (except spiders) read it--are you blogging? Or, to take another analogy, is a podcaster who isn&#039;t making an effective use of rss feeds really podcasting?

I like to try to avoid pronouncements of how a technology should be used, because there is no way to predict how users will put a technology to use. These unexpected uses are frequently the innovative sorts of ideas that push towards the &quot;next&quot; technology.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[â€œSchoolhouse-Rockâ€ style music videos help students learn about copyright and fair use

Users&#039; Rights, Section 107 uses catchy lyrics and clever visuals to help people understand how &quot;context and situation determine how fair use applies&quot; to the use of copyrighted materials. What&#039;s Copyright? explains that copyright is not just an owner&#039;s rightâ€”the purpose of copyright law is to promote creativity and the spread of knowledge. The videos are also available on the Media Education Lab&#039;s You Tube channel.

Created by graduate student Mike RobbGrieco (songwriter, producer) of Temple University and animator Geoff Beatty of Germantown Studios, the music videos bring an element of entertainment to lesson plans and classroom activities that help ameliorate copyright confusion among educators and students in both high school and college.

The release of two animated music videos completes the Copyright and Fair Use Curriculum Guide, developed by the Media Education Lab as a component of a two year research project funded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which included the Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Media Literacy Education, released in November at Philadelphia&#039;s National Constitution Center.

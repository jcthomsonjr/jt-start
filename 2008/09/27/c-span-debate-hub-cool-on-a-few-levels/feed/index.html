		<description><![CDATA[Hi John, I have been working with C-SPAN on the Debate Hub project and just came across your blog post.  Appreciate you sharing it with your readers.  

While the site is definitely up, running and linking to blogs during the debates, perhaps the most interesting part is when the debate is over: the transcripts are logged and mashed up with our video.  All searchable, all embeddable.  

Don&#039;t hesitate to contact me with any questions :)

Thanks again,

Leslie

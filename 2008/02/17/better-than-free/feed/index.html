		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a great read, John. Thanks for the link. Here&#039;s my own &quot;but not today&quot;: I&#039;d like to explore how these &quot;generatives&quot; work in an educational context. In a world where &quot;knowledge&quot; is increasingly thought of as free, how can Kelly&#039;s eight generatives (and others we might think of) form an emerging statement of &quot;value&quot; in higher education? Do these generatives help differentiate several years of intense online research and interaction from a university degree program? Is there something in these generatives that helps us define that elusive &quot;Wisconsin Experience&quot; we hope to cultivate here at UW-Madison?]]></description>

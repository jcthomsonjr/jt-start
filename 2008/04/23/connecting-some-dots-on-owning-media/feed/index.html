		<description><![CDATA[I hesitate to say it, because it sounds alarmist, but I&#039;ve heard that border guards are on the lookout for pirated materials.  It might not be too far off to say that something like a suspicious looking dvd could bring them to search your machine.

It&#039;s funny to be a collector in the digital world. I&#039;m not quite as open with what I own, but it seems almost like a replacement for the coffee table or bookshelf.  Something inherently personal--more than just data.

I&#039;m so guilty of being locked into iTunes, and I know it!  As much as I&#039;d like to move to 100% linux, I think my new Nike+ has locked me into the mac platform, at least for awhile.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m something of a collector of books, cds, dvds, etc.  Digitizing my music collection has made it much more accessible, and has helped me rediscover and recontextualize works I originally experienced as far back as 20 years ago.  I&#039;d like to be able to do the same thing with my video collection - but that&#039;s a much more daunting task.  To a certain extent, I enjoy sharing these discoveries, preferences and experiences with others.  No, not file sharing - but sharing the catalog of my experience with these media (Delicious Library exports, Shelfari, etc.).  I probably share too much as the catalogs are online!  The popularity of Amazon, Shelari, Flixster, etc. speak to people&#039;s identification with self and media consumption.  At what point is the line crossed when government or marketing experts start to analyze and use this public data for purposes which weren&#039;t intended?  

On a separate note - if my laptop gets searched at the border and they find mp3s or videos without the original CD or DVD (after all, why would I bring them?) would that be a problem?  Or would it simply raise a border guard&#039;s suspicion enough to give me a little more thorough search?  

Regarding the MSN Music shutdown - I think this was/is everyone&#039;s great fear of DRM realized.  I personally don&#039;t like even buying music from iTunes when I can help it.  When I have a choice I&#039;ll buy DRM-free through Amazon or even better - directly through the artist like NIN, Saul Williams, or Radiohead.]]></description>

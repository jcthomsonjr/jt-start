The purpose of the law was to protect studentâ€™s personal and grade information from things like the grade list on the door and prying parents.

		<description><![CDATA[Bob, I have to say I completely agree. Unfortunately, fear on the behalf of students (over schoolwork that might someday be seen as embarrassing) and of the possibility of a lawsuit has some educational technologists thinking about the law before thinking of the learning possibilities. The same phenomenon is also happening in the copyright arena.

And from some respects--who can blame them? Both are complicated laws.  Directory vs educational information can sometimes be confusing and a fair use analysis gives no guarantees.

To some degree, this may be an effect of a societal rules reaching into more aspects of daily life (or the system colonizing lifeworld, for any Habermas fans). Your site has some great, clear information on FERPA--if we all are going to have to understand these laws on some level, we&#039;ll need more work like yours.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When considering the complexities and potential pitfalls of FERPA it is easy to overlook the obvious:  The student can provide his/her own education records to anyone, by any means, at any time.  The student can also consent to the disclosure of his/her records by the school.  When a student participates in web activities by his/her own volition, or provides consent for the school to include him/her in such activities, FERPA need not be feared!]]></description>

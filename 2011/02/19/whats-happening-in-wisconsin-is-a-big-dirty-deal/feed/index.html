		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Scott.  I&#039;m thinking of updating this post a bit, but have also toyed with the idea of more regular updates.  It&#039;s hard to find the balance between the ease of social networking and (finding the time for) the depth you can get with a blog post.

Other readers, you might also check out Scott&#039;s blog for some thoughts on being on the front lines.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Late in posting a comment, but great write up. The mantra, &quot;Its not about the money.&quot; is getting tiresome I think for some, but working. As the fact that unions have made financial concessions gets spread, yet the Governor continues his course, it becomes more and more apparent that the budget crisis argument was just a convenient (though related) smoke screen to the real political issue of crippling big supporters of the Democratic party. Its not even about worker rights, its about politics, which makes it even worse. The short story to all of the last two weeks is that: Walker is putting politics BEFORE the people of this state. While I give credit to Walker&#039;s consistency on the playback of his phone call, just by his attitude it solidifies in concrete that this bill move has been, from the start, about busting unions. My brother-in-law shared with me last night that, the longer this goes on the more people associate the general negatives of the situation with the people in power. Like any organization, unions have their issues, but lets focus on how to collectively mitigate that impact working with the municipalities (if that&#039;s the real goal as Walker claims it is) rather than trying to make the climate difficult for them to exist.]]></description>
